### How to play

The player must guess a number between 1 and 50.

The player has 20 tries to guess the number. If the player fails to guess the number in 20 tries, the game is over.

Your score represents the number of tries left to guess the number.

Every time you guess the wrong number, your score decreases by 1.

After each attempt to guess the number the computer will give hints to the player, telling if the number is higher or lower than the one the player guessed.

When you guess the correct number, your score is saved to the highscore.

The higher the score, the better.

Your highscore is the highest score you have ever achieved.
